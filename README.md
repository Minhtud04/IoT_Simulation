# Project Description
This project aims to detect defectious and/or injected malicious node within an environment of sensor.
Data are gathered within a simulated environment for easy data manipulation. It also help setting the controlled environment of nodes.
We used machine learning to select out the most viable machine learning algorithm to detect malicious node (yes, ml within ml).
